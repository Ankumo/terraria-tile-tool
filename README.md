# Terraria Tile Tool

### Lets you replace your world tiles and walls globally. Primarily used as a 1-click Clentaminator ;)

&nbsp;

### `Warning! Use it at your own risk! I'm not responsible for broken world files. Make sure you have backed up your world file before using this tool.`

&nbsp;

### PC world file versions `1.3.0.1` - `1.4.4.*` are supported

(I believe, tested only latest version)

&nbsp;

[Online version](https://ttt.ankumo.ru/) (no installation or downloading needed)

Offline version - coming soon

&nbsp;

## By default you're able to:

1. Purify Corruption
2. Purify Crimson
3. Purify Hallow
4. Remove Dungeon Cracked Bricks
5. Remove Dungeon Spikes
6. Remove Temple Spikes
7. Clear Meteorite (replace with dirt)

_Additionally, you can create your own custom swaps and share them._ `[Beta]`

&nbsp;

## Why though?

I love to beat every new Terraria world alone. Though you need to do too much of terraforming and optimizations to keep yourself calmly grinding your favorite items. Oh, this is giving you a hard time too? Then this tool will come in handy! Here's my setup:

1. Create a world (Large, Master everytime)
2. Remove Dungeon/Temple spikes and Dungeon cracked bricks using this tool
3. Casually playing until ready to beat Wall of flesh
4. Getting rid of Crimson/Corruption using this tool
5. Entering hardmode
6. Casually playing until ready to beat Plantera
7. Purifying world once again
8. Building buffered (4 empty blocks spacers) containtments for Crimson/Corruption and Hallow on surface and in caverns (right above the underworld).
9. Fun playing free of conversion headaches (like broken pilons, dead jungle, etc) until obtained a Zenith

_With this setup you don't even have to worry about how's your world has been generated. Even if Crimson/Corruption is just 1 screen away from your spawn point it'd be cleaned before you'll enter hardmode._

&nbsp;

### `Keep in mind` that after you breaking Crimson/Corruption `altars`, it'll convert 1 random cavern layer `Stone Block` in your world with 66.67% chance, so it may `spread` again. Be sure to destroy them as much as you need `before` using this tool for purifying.

## Todo:

-   [ ] Better component decomposition
-   [ ] Fix contenteditables
-   [ ] More branches
-   [ ] Better dropdowns (debounce, content overflow)
-   [ ] Custom swap creation guides
-   [ ] Maybe consider to make headers for each menu
-   [ ] Better swap missions preparation
-   [ ] Remake filters constants in js to css classes
-   [ ] Better array buffers linking and integration
-   [ ] Sometimes BG change is too slow on loading assets
-   [ ] Offline version (rethink web workers)
